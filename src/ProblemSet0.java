/**
 * Problem Set 0.
 *
 * It's time to put your skills to the test. This problem set focuses on printing
 * text to the console, as well as identifying and correcting compilation and
 * runtime errors in the supplied program code.
 *
 * The specifications for each exercise are outlined below. I've written most of
 * the functionality for you, but unfortunately, my code is riddled with mistakes.
 * It's your job to fix the errors I've made, so that the code meets the
 * requirements set forth in this section (as well as the Deliverables section).
 *
 * Work through these exercises on your own. Experiment, make mistakes, ask
 * questions, and fix your mistakes. It's the only way to get good at programming.
